```{r}
data <- read_csv("../../_data/eggs_tidy.csv")
head(data)
data%>%
  select(starts_with("extra"))%>%
  filter(data$extra_large_dozen > 260)%>%
  arrange(desc(extra_large_dozen), desc(extra_large_half_dozen))%>%
  summarize(mean(extra_large_dozen), mean(extra_large_half_dozen))

```

Working on Regression of if certain months have an impact on the number of eggs produced

```{r}
data%>%
