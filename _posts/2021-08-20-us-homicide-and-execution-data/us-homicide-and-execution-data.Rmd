Loading in the tidyverse package:

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
```

### About the data
This data set is a table of all executions carried out in the United States starting from when the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976 until the data was collected in 2016. It was published by the Death Penalty Information Center.

Reading in the file, assigning it to variable exec, and displaying the first ten rows:

```{r}
exec <- read.csv("/Users/leahleahleah/Documents/Data/executions.csv")
head(exec, 10)
```
