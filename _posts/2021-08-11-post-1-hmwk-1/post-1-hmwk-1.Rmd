```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
vector <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
new_vector <- c(3,5,1,1,2)
avg_vector <- (vector + new_vector)/2
perc_vector <- avg_vector/5
final_vector <- perc_vector*100
```

First I input two vectors: vector = `r vector` and new_vector = `r new_vector`
Then I take the average of these two vectors creating avg_vector = `r avg_vector`
Then I divide the average of the vectors by 5 (perc_vector = `r perc_vector`) and finally I multiple the vector by 100 (final_vector = `r final_vector`).
