Education/Work Background: I worked in retail management for many years and am currently entering my final semester to finish my undergraduate degree in Math/Stats.

Program: DACSS

R experience: I used R for several classes and did several projects in the past few years.

Research interests: Public Policy, machine learning, criminal punishment system, and social movements

Fun fact: I have bowled a perfect game (300).

Below is a scatter plot of 250 randomly generated data points.

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
#set seed to reproduce results
set.seed(327)
#randomly generate 250 int from 1-100
X <- sample.int(100, 250, replace=TRUE) 
#randomly generate 250 int from 1-100
Y <- sample.int(100, 250, replace=TRUE)
#scatter plot of X, Y
plot(X, Y, xlab="X Samples", ylab="Y Samples",
     pch = 16, col = "red")
```
